 #Tic Tac Toe
   You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think!

Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.

#Rules for Tic-Tac-Toe
   1.The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
   2.You are X , your friend (or the computer in this case) is O . Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
   3.The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
   4.When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

# How can I win at Tic-Tac-Toe?

         To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.

Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three X s in a row. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three O s in a row.

After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X ? You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choices which ones might let you make three X s in a row.

You also have to watch where the computer puts its O . That could change what you do next. If the computer gets two O s in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the computer will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.

If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at least you'll tie.
     
 # description

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
